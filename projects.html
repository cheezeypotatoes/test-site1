        <h3><a href="https://github.com/cheezeypotatoes/cheezeyCalculator">Github Repo</a></h3>
        <p>This is still in progress though mostly complete and completley functional. Negative number support and multiple operations (more than one operator) has been added. Reactivness has been addressed as well. Something to add now would be keyboard support and a an additional row of buttons. Say for modulus, backspace, decimal point and on/off button. Calculator would not display anything nor react to button clicks until it is "powered on" then go dormant when "powered off"</p>

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/cheezeypotatoes/cheezeyHangMan">Github Repo</a></h3>
        <p>This is fully functional although not much to look at. The logic running the game took me some time to figure out. I would like to come back to this and make it much more visually attractive. Possibly add a hangman being drawn out.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/cheezeypotatoes/Cheezey-Sketch-Pad">Github Repo</a></h3>
        <p>A Nifty little sketch pad I made. It's not without issues however. I need to address why some colors wont be over written. Probably just an issue of needing to remove the proper div classes but none the less I was happy to get it working as it is now.</p>
