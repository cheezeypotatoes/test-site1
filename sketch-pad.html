    <div class="welcome">Hello and welcome to my cheezey sketchpad. This was a project assignment from The Odin Project's web development 101 course. It is an exercise of knowing basic html and css, with javascript and jquery. It works very simply. Select a grid size from the dropdown above and click create. Once your cheezey sketchpad has been prepared you can begin to draw by selecting a color from the dropdown menu, moving the cursor over the sketchpad and clicking once. This will begin to draw as you move the mouse over the sketchpad. If you want to stop drawing, click again and the cursor will stop drawing and allow you to move to another area to click and begin drawing again. To change colors, first click to stop drawing then select a new color.
