      Welcome, my name is Curt. I'm a home study web dev learner devoted to becoming a professional developer. It is with great pleasure that I welcome you to my website. Just what exactly is my website you might ask? My website is my sandbox to practice my development skills, to showcase what I have learned and to share my experience with others as I learn it. Follow me as I share and discuss current projects and blog about my experiences along the way on this journey.
