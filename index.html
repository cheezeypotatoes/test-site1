      Welcome, my name is Curt. I'm a home study web dev learner devoted to becoming a professional developer. It is with great pleasure that I welcome you to my website. Just what exactly is my website you might ask? My website is my sandbox to practice my development skills, to showcase what I have learned and to share my experience with others as I learn it. Follow me as I share and discuss current projects and blog about my experiences along the way on this journey.

      Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry’s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
